# portfolio
html/css for my portfolio website.
feel free to use my code as a reference - and email me if you see any potential bugs or issues! just use your discretion about how you use this :-) all of this code was created by me from scratch unless stated otherwise!
(some visual inspiration was taken from the portfolio websites of great ui/ux and product designers such as Olivia Truong, Elizabeth Lin, and Zorin Roman)
